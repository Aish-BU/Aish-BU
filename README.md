### Credit Risk Modeling ‚Äì PD, LGD, EAD, and EL 
*[Repository Link](https://github.com/Aish-BU/Credit_Risk_Modelling)*  

Built a credit risk modeling framework in Python to calculate **Probability of Default (PD)**, **Loss Given Default (LGD)**, **Exposure at Default (EAD)**, and **Expected Loss (EL)**, aligning with Basel III/IFRS-9 standards.

‚úÖ **Technical Contributions:**
- Developed classification models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**) to estimate PD from borrower characteristics and macroeconomic indicators  
- Applied regression models and **survival analysis** to forecast LGD, incorporating collateral values and recovery rates  
- Estimated EAD using credit conversion factors and exposure dynamics; combined PD, LGD, and EAD to compute portfolio-level EL  
- Conducted **stress testing and scenario analysis** to evaluate model resilience under macroeconomic shocks  
- Validated models using **ROC/AUC, confusion matrix, precision/recall, and backtesting** to ensure robustness and regulatory alignment  

üí° **Impact:**  
Delivered a scalable, **machine learning‚Äìdriven framework** for credit risk estimation, enabling accurate capital allocation, risk segmentation, and regulatory compliance.  

üìä **Tech Stack:**

### üéµ Spotify KNN Classification Project  
*[Repository Link](https://github.com/Aish-BU/Spotify-Music-Recommendation-Listener-Preference-Analysis)* 

A dataset of **2,017 Spotify songs** with 17 audio features (danceability, valence, acousticness, speechiness, etc.) was used to predict whether a listener (*George*) liked (`1`) or disliked (`0`) each track.  

The goal was to build a **classification model** that outperforms the baseline 50% accuracy.  

I conducted **t-tests** to identify significant predictors (danceability, speechiness, valence, acousticness) and removed non-significant ones (tempo, energy, liveness). The data was **normalized** and split into **60% training (1,211 songs)** and **40% validation (806 songs)**. KNN models were evaluated for **k = 1‚Äì35**.  

The **best performance occurred at k = 31**, achieving **~65.6% accuracy** (~15% above baseline). Liked songs were more danceable (+0.058), higher in valence (+0.056), and more speech-heavy (+0.027), while disliked songs were more acoustic (+0.076). For example, *‚ÄúEnemy ‚Äì Arcane‚Äù* by Imagine Dragons was correctly predicted as **liked**.  

**Conclusion:** KNN effectively captured music preference patterns from acoustic features, demonstrating its potential for **personalized recommendation systems**.
